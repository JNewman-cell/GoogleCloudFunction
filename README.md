# GoogleCloudFunction

This code is a Google Cloud Function named sendEmails that executes periodically to provide users with daily commute information via email. It leverages Firebase services for database management and Nodemailer for email transmission. Operating between 8 AM and 11 AM from Monday to Friday in the America/Los_Angeles timezone, the function retrieves user data from Firestore and verifies if users have provided necessary commute details such as email, home and work addresses, and departure time. When a user's specified departure time matches the current time, it employs the Google Maps API to calculate the best route and time estimate for the commute. Then, it constructs an email containing this information along with a static map image illustrating the route. This email is sent using Nodemailer, ensuring the user receives timely and pertinent commute updates. Throughout the process, the function logs events and errors to facilitate debugging.
